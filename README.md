**Number Guessing Game**
This is a simple Java console-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 
The player has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number correctly. 
After each game, the player can choose to play again, and their score is tracked across multiple rounds.
